The project involves the development of a Shortest Path Calculation Algorithm tailored for a directed graph that serves as a representation of a 
Snakes and Ladders gameboard. The algorithm, triggered from the starting point, systematically evaluates all possible moves (rolls of 1 â€“ 6) at each node, selecting the most 
strategic one to progress toward the destination. This process is recursive, with the algorithm recording the movement and the sequence of rolls made at each step. The goal is 
to efficiently navigate the gameboard, minimizing the total number of rolls required to reach the destination. Upon successfully reaching the endpoint, the algorithm outputs the 
calculated route, detailing the positions visited and the corresponding rolls made, along with providing the minimum number of rolls needed. The algorithm's implementation optimizes 
decision-making in the context of the Snakes and Ladders game, showcasing potential applications in gaming strategies, educational tools, or scenarios requiring intelligent 
pathfinding on directed graphs.
